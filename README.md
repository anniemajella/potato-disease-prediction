# potato-disease-prediction
Developed an end-to-end Deep Learning project in the field of agriculture.Created a classic Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture. First started with collecting the data, then model building, and finally, used Streamlit to build a web-based application.
